		<p class="p1">I enjoy working in both physical and digital spaces, collaborating with multiple design disciplines to create unique interactions and experiences. I work to synthesize and develop designs through research and prototyping.</p>

		<p class="p2">I've had a passion for design since a young age. In university I realized I wanted to be passionate about my work and transferred from Psychology to the Interactive Art & Technology program at Simon Fraser University. I became exposed to many types of design including graphic, industrial, spatial and interaction.</p>

		<p class="p3">A few of my projects include the Living Shade and N1 Kitchen System. In my Living Shade project I led the design for my team of five in an eight month long capstone project to develop a working dynamic shading system balancing plant and human life. The Kitchen System started out as a three week long study on interaction design but ended up letting me explore many new ideas, concepts and inspirations. I have learned to explore ideas from the large scale down the the smallest details, valuing every element of a design.</p>

		<p class="p4">While I enjoy many types of design I have constantly gravitated towards interaction. I graduated from Simon Fraser in June 2012 with my Bachelor of Arts in Interactive Art & Technology. Currently Product Designer at Bench.</p>
